Ok, so you may have heard the term sustainability thrown around by companies boasting their newly minted benefit corporation badges or sharing some great new eco friendly value statement.... but where did this all start?

The term sustainable development, its definition was formalized for the first time in the document known as the Brundtland Report (1987), the result of the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development, created in the United Nations Assembly in 1983. Said definition was assumed in Principle 3 of the Rio Declaration (1992). Starting in the 1970s, scientists began to realize that many of their actions had a great impact on nature, so some specialists pointed out the obvious loss of biodiversity and developed theories to explain the vulnerability of natural systems. Sustainable development is based on 3 factors: society, economy, and environment. In Brundtland's report, it is defined as follows: Meeting the needs of the present generations without compromising the possibilities of those of the future to meet their own needs.

Development and social welfare are limited by the technological level, the resources of the environment, and the capacity of the environment to absorb the effects of human activity. Faced with this situation, the possibility of improving technology and social organization is raised, so that the environment can recover at the same rate as it is affected by human activity, in order to avoid a deficit of resources.

Sustainable development is a concept developed towards the end of the twentieth century, on the public interest in economic growth and use of natural resources worldwide are allowed, but taking into account global environmental and social aspects, so that In the long term, neither life on the planet nor the quality of life of the human species is compromised or substantively degraded.

The concept of sustainable development reflects a growing awareness of the contradiction that can exist between development and ecological and social conditions so that development can last over time. This awareness of the human, natural, and environmental costs of development and progress has come to modify the attitude of unconcern or justification that prevailed in this regard for a long time. The idea of ​​economic growth without limits and in pursuit of which everything could be sacrificed came to be replaced by an awareness of those limits and of the importance of creating long-term conditions that make possible a well-being for current generations that is not done to the price of a threat or deterioration of the future living conditions of humanity.
